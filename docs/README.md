# 📉 Case Study: Expense Report Cycle Time Reduction
**Kennesaw State University | [cite_start]Six Sigma Green Belt Capstone** [cite: 1, 3]

### 📋 Executive Summary
[cite_start]This project optimized a corporate reimbursement process that was failing to meet its 5-day Service Level Agreement (SLA)[cite: 4, 5]. [cite_start]As the **Project Team Lead**, I managed a cross-functional team to identify root causes for a 12-day average cycle time and implemented data-driven improvements[cite: 7, 22].

### 🔍 The Problem (Define & Measure)
* **Problem Statement**: The average cycle time for expense reports was 12 days, resulting in a 25% dissatisfaction rate and approximately $2,500 annually in late charges[cite: 5].
* **Baseline Metrics**:
    * **Average Cycle Time**: 12.0 Days[cite: 5, 51].
    * [cite_start]**Reprocessing Rate**: 60% of reports required corrections[cite: 5, 52].
* [cite_start]**Goal**: Reduce the average cycle time to 5 days by March 13, 2026[cite: 5].

### 🔬 Statistical Analysis (Analyze)
[cite_start]Using **One-Way ANOVA**, I moved beyond intuition to statistically validate the root cause of delays[cite: 107, 119]:

* [cite_start]**Group A (Correct Reports)**: 4.0 Days average[cite: 122].
* **Group B (Defect Reports)**: 17.3 Days average[cite: 123].
* [cite_start]**P-Value**: < 0.001 (Confirming a statistically significant difference)[cite: 124, 125].
* [cite_start]**Pareto Analysis**: Revealed that **67% of defects** were caused by "Missing Receipts"[cite: 108, 130].
* **Root Cause**: The process relied on human vigilance rather than system controls (Poka-Yoke) to ensure data quality[cite: 138, 139].



### 🛠️ Improvement & Control
* [cite_start]**Selected Solution**: Implemented a mandatory submission checklist and updated the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)[cite: 153, 156].
* [cite_start]**Policy Update**: New rule mandates administrative rejection of reports without receipts within 24 hours[cite: 157].
* **Sustainability**: Established a weekly Control Plan to monitor reprocessing rates[cite: 175, 176].

### 📊 Final Results (Simulated)
| Metric | Baseline | Goal | Result (March 2026) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Avg Cycle Time** | 12.0 Days [cite: 51] | 5.0 Days [cite: 5] | **3.4 Days** [cite: 168] |
| **Reprocessing Rate** | 60% [cite: 52] | <10% [cite: 5] | **10%** [cite: 169] |
