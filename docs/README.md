📈 Case Study: Expense Report Cycle Time Reduction
Kennesaw State University | Six Sigma Green Belt Capstone

Overview
This project focused on optimizing a corporate reimbursement process that was failing to meet its 5-day Service Level Agreement (SLA). By applying the DMAIC framework, I identified root causes for a 12-day average cycle time and implemented data-driven improvements.

🔍 The Problem (Define & Measure)

Problem Statement: The average cycle time for expense reports was 12 days, resulting in a 25% dissatisfaction rate and approximately $2,500 annually in late charges.

Baseline Metrics:


Average Cycle Time: 12.0 Days.


Reprocessing Rate: 60% of reports required corrections.


Goal: Reduce the average cycle time to 5 days by March 13, 2026.

🔬 Statistical Analysis (Analyze)
Using One-Way ANOVA, I statistically validated the root cause of delays:


Group A (Correct Reports): 4.0 Days average.


Group B (Defect Reports): 17.3 Days average.


P-Value: < 0.001 (Confirming a statistically significant difference).


Pareto Analysis: Revealed that 67% of defects were caused by "Missing Receipts".


Root Cause: The current system lacked Poka-Yoke (error-proofing), allowing users to click "Submit" without an attached receipt.

🛠️ Improvement & Control

Selected Solution: Implemented a mandatory submission checklist and updated the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).


Policy Update: New rule requiring administrative rejection of reports without receipts within 24 hours.


Sustainability: Established a weekly Control Plan to monitor reprocessing rates.
