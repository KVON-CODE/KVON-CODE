# 📉 Case Study: Expense Report Cycle Time Reduction
[cite_start]**Capstone Project - Kennesaw State University Six Sigma Green Belt** [cite: 1, 3]

### 📋 Overview
[cite_start]This technical case study involved leading a cross-functional team to identify and resolve process inefficiencies in a corporate reimbursement workflow. [cite: 5, 7, 22]

### 🔬 Data Analysis Highlights
* [cite_start]**Hypothesis Testing:** Conducted a **One-Way ANOVA** to compare "Correct" vs. "Defect" reports, resulting in a **P-Value of < 0.001**, statistically proving that reprocessing loops were the primary driver of the 12-day delay. [cite: 119, 120, 124, 126]
* [cite_start]**Root Cause Identification:** Utilized **Pareto Analysis** to isolate that **67% of defects** originated from "Missing Receipts." [cite: 108, 130]
* [cite_start]**Process Mapping:** Documented the "Voice of the Process" using a SIPOC/Process Map to identify where system error-proofing (Poka-Yoke) was absent. [cite: 15, 57, 138]

### 📈 Simulated Results
* [cite_start]**Cycle Time Improvement:** Successfully modeled a reduction in average cycle time from **12.0 days to 3.4 days**. [cite: 168]
* [cite_start]**Error Mitigation:** Reduced the simulated reprocessing rate from **60% to 10%** via standardized SOPs and policy updates. [cite: 169]
