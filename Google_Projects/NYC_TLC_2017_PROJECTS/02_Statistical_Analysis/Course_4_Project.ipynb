    "## 2 Course 4 End-of-course project: Statistical analysis\n",
    "In this activity, you will practice using statistics to analyze and interpret data. The activity covers\n",
    "fundamental concepts such as descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing. You will explore the\n",
    "data provided and conduct A/B and hypothesis testing.\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to demostrate knowledge of how to prepare, create, and analyze\n",
    "A/B tests. Your A/B test results should aim to find ways to generate more revenue for taxi cab\n",
    "drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For the purpose of this exercise, assume that the sample data comes from an experiment in\n",
    "which customers are randomly selected and divided into two groups: 1) customers who are required\n",
    "to pay with credit card, 2) customers who are required to pay with cash. Without this assumption,\n",
    "we cannot draw causal conclusions about how payment method affects fare amount.\n",
    "The goal is to apply descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing in Python. The goal for this A/B\n",
    "test is to sample data and analyze whether there is a relationship between payment type and fare\n",
    "amount. For example: discover if customers who use credit cards pay higher fare amounts than\n",
    "customers who use cash.\n",
    "\n",
    "### This activity has four parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1: Imports and data loading **\n",
    "\n",
    "* What data packages will be necessary for hypothesis testing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A: Pandas and scipy will be needed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2: Conduct EDA and hypothesis testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* How did computing descriptive statistics help you analyze your data?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A: It allows me to see basic stats like mean, std, and the quartile distributions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* How did you formulate your null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A: I used a significance level of 5% (0.05), comparing the sets of cash and credit card using a t-test. **\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 3: Communicate insights with stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "* What key business insight(s) emerged from your A/B test?\n",
    "\n",
    "**There is a significant difference between payment types.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* What business recommendations do you propose based on your results?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Leading customers to pay with a credit card would be beneficial in creating higher fares for the Taxi/Limo Industry in NYC. Future modeling or a study could be performed to see if this would indeed increase profitability.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions and answer the questions below to complete the activity. Then, you will\n",
    "complete an Executive Summary using the questions listed on the PACE Strategy Document.\n",
    "\n",
